# WalletEye
A software for tracking expenses and splitting it between people involved.

This software is composed by **Users**, each one with its own **Wallets** where money can be deposited or withdrew.

Users can also create **Expenses Groups** and add another users to it. The expenses added to this group can be split equally or participants can be defined for each expense. A user can also link to each expense group one of his wallets so that it automatically gets money from it when some new expense is added.
